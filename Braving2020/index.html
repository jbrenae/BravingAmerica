      <center><b>As the year nears its end, we are all wondering "How did we make it this far?" "What's happening in our country?" We all have our differences, beliefs, point of views and lives! However, some of the main events of 2020 have been added here for your sanity! At times we just want to laugh at the insanity and sometimes we all just want to scream and cry in frustration! I'm sure we have all done those things in abundance. I'm sure we all just wished this year to be over and to feel like we have a "fresh start" when the year 2021 arrives. How much of 2020 will we be taking with us into the new year? Who will be running and representing our country, will this Covid19 pandemic go away? Will reform happen within the Police Departments? What about our childrens education? So many unanswered questions! Although I may not know all the answers, I do know how to maintain my sanity and survive the madness that we are all going through! Take a look into Braving 2020: Recap </b></center>
